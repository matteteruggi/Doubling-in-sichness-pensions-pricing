# Doubling in sickness pensions pricing
A montecarlo simulation for pricing doubling in sickness pensions with a semi-markov chain.
Long term care is becoming a relevant aspect of our society, and a possible exit strategy comes
from financial markets. In particular, doubling-in-sickness pensions might reveal helpfull in helping 
for the constitution of a functioning LTC market. Instead of buyng a stand-alone LTC product, the insured buys an annuity that doubles
if the he/she loses his/her authonomy. In the matlab code the detailed path toward montecarlo pricing is describer, while
in the two pdf files the main results are presented. Email matteo.teruggi2@unibo.it for more details
Abstract: Long term care is an emerging field of life insurance: according to the U.S. Department of 
Human Services, 70% of adults 65 and over will require some type of long-term care during their 
lives and that is why this scope is devoted one-third of the Medicaid programme. To quantify the 
problem, we report some consideration on the economic and social-psychological cost of caregiving. 
The efficiency of the private market on underwriting this risk is highly discussed by N. Barr (2010), 
for questions of asymmetric information and (genetic) adverse selection. The main difference with 
acute health insurance is the whole life length of the contract for long term care, instead of the year 
over year payment. Among the different long-term contracts, we consider a possible option for 
converting the savings of Italian pension funds: instead of buying an ordinary annuity, it is possible 
to buy a contract that pays a doubled amount if the individuals lose his autonomy. To fairly price this 
enhanced pension, we introduce the role of natural hedging in insurance and explain how it is possible 
to profit from this in life insurance. We then recover mathematical set-up through the instruments of 
Markov chains to reach closed formulae (only Markov) and algorithmic pricing with Montecarlo 
simulation. Before reaching this, we will discuss how to estimate transition probabilities for the 
transition matrix, according to the approach proposed by Levantesi and Menzietti (2016). Results of 
our experiment are relevant: the benefit from hedging coming from the anticorrelation between life 
expectancy and morbidity (invalidity) is mainly attributable to males but is substantially used to 
decrease the premium load on femalesâ€™ contracts. Males and females could be seen as diversified 
assets of an insurance portfolio and the equilibrium level might be reached only with enough 
incentives. We even investigate additional guarantees, a lumpsum at losing autonomy and a death 
case one, for their relevant role in risk reduction and in absorbing insurance needs.
